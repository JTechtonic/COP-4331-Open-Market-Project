Open Market Project for COP4331C Spring24

This fork is for posting this project on my GitHub. I (Jeovan Teixeira) worked alongside my group to develop this MERN stack in Spring 2024 for COP4331C at the University of Central Florida. My contributions include the server.js file where I developed the Express server and made the API routes for the project. I also made documentation for the API in the swagger.yaml file.
